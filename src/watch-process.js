  // [2025-01] Notes on the different relaunch solution we explored here:
  // - `chokidar` does not provide a way to restart the process when a dependency,
  // which is outside the watched directory is changed. Which is rather bad DX
  // - `nodemon` has the same problem, while it may look like the opposite in a simple
  // testbad. It restarts the process even the changed does not concern it... probably
  // because it watches process.cwd() by default, so same behavior as with `chokidar`
  // but with larger "watch" scope
  // - `node --watch` looks like the most suited solution for our use-case:
  //  + released as stable in node v20.13 (May 7, 2024) and v22.0.0
  //  + when file is update through rsync, flag `--inplace` must be passed to
  //    trigger the restart on Linux.
